  Hello! I am Jackelyn! 
  <div>I am an art and design major at San Jacinto.
     It has always been my dream to be an animator, 
  but I never had enough confidence in my abilities as an artist. 
  I never thought I would even have the privlage of 
  going to college for an art degree. 
  I'm very happy to be here! </div>
      <div>This website will mostly be used as a personal portfolio. 
  I have so many files that I would like to store
  somewhere to free up space for new projects. I also dont 
   get to show off my work that often, however, that may
  be a fear of rejection. I hope this website will alow me to 
  show all of my favorite artworks :D. </div>
        <div>I believe that we shouldn't take life too seriously, 
    so I've decided to put my favorite funny websites
    here as well in case anyone needs to have a good laugh.
    <div><a href="https://roing.us/" target="_blank">Roing.us</a></div>
    <div><a href="https://patatap.com/" target="_blank">papatap.com</a></div>
    <div>If you live my work and have an amazing idea that you want brought to life, feel free to commision me!</div>
    <div> <a href="./Commisionform.html">Commision form!</a></div>
        <div>I may also put some pictures of me here just so the
      people know who they're commisioning? or maybe just of my art
      form me, Spirit.</div>
