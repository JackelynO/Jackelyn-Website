        <div>This is my Youtube link, I think. It's hard
        to put animations on a website while keeping quality
        so its probably for the better to put a youtube link. 
        While I haven't started a youtube yet, I'll put the one
        thats already made here. I haven't started for yet again,
        the fear of failing : D.</div>

        <div>But since I have nothing there right now, I will
        put placeholder pictures for GIFs. Also in case some people
        just don't want to go to youtube.</div>
