        This cat drawing was made in January of 2024. This was for a project in
        my AP Literature class on a book report. The book I choose to read was
        titled "Kitty Cat Kill Sat". It was a great book on a cat in space
        trying to save the world. I wanted to add some art into my PowerPoint,
        so I drew many cats, and this was my favorite one.
