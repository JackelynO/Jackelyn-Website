# Jackelyn-Website
This is my Portfolio Website! All of my favorite artworks are here! Hopefully someday this can be used to get my name out in public and gain commissions! 
I based my color scemes off of my mascot Spirit. Her color sceme is primarily purples and blues, so thats why my website has her everywhere and her color pallete. I wanted this website to feel like a shopping website like Amazon or walmart.com, but I also wanted it to have some "home made" feeling. I didn't want it to look so professional that its a sad and fake corperate job. I think I nailed it. 
I struggled a lot with the media queries, but I think the issue was my web browser? When I would try to resize with the inspect tool, sometimes it would break. When I would just resize my window, it worked fine. I also heavily struggled with aligning things to the center... I'm still not sure if my images are centered... I'm unsure if this is a grid issue or a flex box issue. I just added enough of a gap in my grids to where it seems like they are centered... I hope they are... On my screen they look like they are...
